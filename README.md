# Pong
Pong game that is written in Python!

Include sounds when the ball leaves one side of the field (the sounds recorded in Hebrew).

Warning - not running the game using CMD can cause errors because I am using relative location to the folder
with the pictures and sounds. For example - in VS code the script didn't work without specifying the exact full location of the files on the PC.


Special setting: 

Random ball size - 
Every time the ball leaves one side of the field, it will change size randomly.
